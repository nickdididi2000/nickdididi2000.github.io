# Abstract

Despite their importance in the social safety net, Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits
are expected to increase unemployment duration. I find that males, on average, face a greater
drop in unemployment than females when (UI) is no longer offered in their respective state.
Male’s unemployment rate dropped more by a magnitude of 0.7 percent compared to female’s
which consists of about 11.5 percent of male unemployment during UI. Females who were
married, were in lower family income brackets, or had children saw smaller changes in
unemployment when UI programs were exhausted.
