Throughout Macalester I’ve had the opportunity to\nnot only be a student under amazing professors, but to be a teaching\nassistant for Introduction to Statistical Modeling (STAT 155),\nIntroduction to Computer Science (COMP 123), Principles of Economics\n(ECON 119), and Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 253), as well as a\nsupplemental instructor for Econometrics (ECON 381). All of my\nexperiences helped me find my passion for understanding concepts at a\ndeep level. Being a teaching assistant and supplemental instructor\ntaught me that one of the best ways to master a topic, and understand\nits ins and outs, is through the process of teaching. Perhaps I will\nfind myself to be a professor one day!\nIn the summer of 2019, I conducted Causal Inference research with\nProfessor Leslie Myint in collaboration with Professor Devavani\nChatterjea in Biology. In this research project, we used the PLoS and\nSemnantic MEDLINE outputs in hopes of creating a diagram to better\nunderstand causal relationships between agents in Professor Chattergea’s\nwork regarding vulvodynia. We did so by using journal abstracts to build\na correlation matrix and run it through Tetrad, a causal search program.\nThis was my first research project and I was astonished by how it pushed\nme to develop self autonomy and independent research skills while\nlearning to collaborate on an interdisciplinary team.\nIn the summer of 2020, I interned as a business analyst at U.S.\nBank’s wealth management division. Here I learned how to navigate a\ncorporate environment and to effectively integrate my working style into\nan agile team.\nBetween my summers, I took a semester of leave to work at NutriKarma,\na startup based in New York. My official position was “lead business\ndeveloper.” However, while managing different projects, I discovered my\npassion for the technical and analytical side of operations.\nDuring the summer of 2021, I interned on Ernst & Young’s\nQuantitative Economics and Statistics (QUEST) team. Here I enhanced my\nanalytical skills through using R, STATA, and SAS. Working in a\nconsulting environment also enhanced my interpersonal skills,\nspecifically learning to effectively communicate quantitative analysis\ninto information that can be used in business decisions.\nIn the 2021-2022 school year, I picked up an independent research\nproject under the guidance of Professor Amy Damon. My project looked to\nexplore the gendered impact of COVID-19, particularly in the context of\nUnemployment Insurance expiring. I managed to publish the thesis at The\nDeveloping Economist and also win the best undergraduate paper award at\nthe 2022 Minnesota Economics Association conference.\nSummer of 2022 I was a research analyst at Brattle Group! I supported\nleading academics in building advanced econometric models to determine\nliability and estimated damages in litigation that were tailored to the\ndata and institutional contexts of the projects.\nAt my last semester of College, I am working part time with Dr. Brian\nCaffo at Johns Hopkins and self-learning and researching Causal\nInference methods.\n\n\n\n",
