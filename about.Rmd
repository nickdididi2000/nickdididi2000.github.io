I am currently a senior at Macalester College who will be graduating in December 2022. Throughout Macalester I've had the opportunity to not only be a student under amazing professors, but also be a teaching assistant for Introduction to Statistical Modeling (STAT 155), Introduction to Computer Science (COMP 123), Principles of Economics (ECON 119), Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 253) and be a supplemental instructor for Econometrics (ECON 381). All of my experiences helped me find my passion for understanding concepts at a deep level. Being a teaching assistant and supplemental instructor taught me how one of the best ways to master a topic is to understand the ins and outs through the process of teaching. Perhaps I may find myself to be a professor one day!  

In the summer of 2019, I spent my time with Professor Myint conducting Causal Inference research. In this research project, we used the PLoS and Semnantic MEDLINE outputs in hopes of creating a causal diagram by building a correlation matrix through R and running it through Tetrad, a casual search program. This was my first research project and I was astonished by how research projects can push you to learn and develop on a self autonomy basis while learning to collaborate with others. 

Summer of 2020, I was a business analyst intern at U.S. Bank’s wealth management division. I familiarized myself working in a corporate environment and learned how to effectively integrate my workstyle into an agile team. 

Between my summers, I decided to take a semester of leave to work at NutriKarma, a start up based in New York. My official position was lead business developer, however, while working and project managing different tasks, I discovered my passion for the technical and analytical side of operations 

Summer of 2021, I interned at Ernst & Young’s Quantitative Economics and Statistics (QUEST) team. I was able to enhance my analytical skills through using SAS, STATA and R. Working in a consulting environment also enhanced my interpersonal skills, specifically learning to effectively communicate quantitative analysis into information that can be used in business decisions. 

In the 2021-2022 school year, I picked up an independent research project under the guideance of Professor Damon. Through a year's length of hard work, I managed to publish an economics paper that won the best undergraduate paper award at the Minnesota Economics Association conference. 

This upcoming summer I will be at Brattle Group as a research assistant!
