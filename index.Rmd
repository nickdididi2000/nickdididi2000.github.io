Greetings, welcome to my portfolio! I am a PhD Student in Statistics at Rice University! I graduated from Macalester College with a double major in Economics (Honors) and Applied Math/Statistics. I am particularly interested in Econometrics, Causal Inference, and Machine Learning/Statistics theory. Outside of school, I enjoy weightlifting, hiking, and skiing!
